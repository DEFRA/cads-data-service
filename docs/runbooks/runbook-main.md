**Service-specific Alerts:** TBD

## Common Failure Modes & Incident Procedures

**TBD** - No specific failure modes or incidents have been identified yet. This section will be updated as operational experience is gained and patterns emerge.

## Release & Rollback Procedures

### Deployment Process
All deployments handled through the CDP Portal

### Rollback Process
Rollbacks are handled be redeploying the previous version through the CDP Portal

### Validation Steps
- Health check returns "Healthy"
- API endpoints respond correctly
- Queue processing resumed
- External integrations working
- No error spike in logs

## Configuration & Secrets

### Configuration Sources
- **Primary**: Environment variables
- **Local**: `docker-compose.override.yml`
- **Deployed**: Environment variables defined in `cdp-app-config` repo

### Secret Rotation
1. Update secrets in secret management system
2. Update environment configuration
3. Restart service to pick up changes
4. Verify connectivity to all dependent services

## Security & Compliance

### Authentication/Authorization

### API Gateway Client Credentials
 - **Recycling client secrets**: The team can request for the client secret to be recycled by the CDP team. The CDP team can rotate the credentials by creating a new one and then expiring the old one after confirmationo that the new one is in use. CDP do not enforce any fixed rotation period.

### Data Classification
- **PII**: Contains personal information of livestock keepers
- **Business Critical**: Essential for livestock traceability
- **Retention**: Follow DEFRA data retention policies

### Audit Logging
- All API requests logged with correlation IDs
- Queue message processing tracked
- Health check executions recorded
- Configuration changes audited

### Compliance Notes
- GDPR compliance for personal data
- DEFRA data handling requirements
- AWS security best practices
